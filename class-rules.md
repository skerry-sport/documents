# Skerry Sport One-Design Class Association

### Class Rules and Charter


***

## 1. Purpose and Objectives

The Skerry Sport One-Design Class exists to:

- Promote safe, friendly, and enjoyable racing in boats built from Skerry kits or plans as published by Chesapeake Light Craft (CLC).
- Provide fair competition where sailing skill outweighs construction differences.
- Support local fleets with consistent rules while allowing for builder creativity within reason.
- Foster community among Skerry Sport sailors through organized events and good sportsmanship.

***

## 2. Class Governance

### 2.1 Class Association

The *Skerry Sport One-Design Class Association (SSODCA)* is the governing body for the class. Its purpose is to administer the rules, promote the class, and coordinate activities with local fleets.

### 2.2 Officers

The Association shall elect the following officers annually:

- **Commodore**: Serves as chief representative and ensures adherence to class rules.
- **Fleet Captain**: Oversees measurement, local fleet organization, and rules compliance.
- **Secretary**: Maintains records, publishes notices, and assists with communications.
- **Treasurer**: Manages class funds, dues, and regatta budgets.


### 2.3 Membership

Any individual owning or sailing a boat built from the Skerry kit or plans may become a member of the Class Association by registering and paying annual dues as determined by the membership.

## 3. Boat Eligibility and Measurement

### 3.1 Eligibility

Boats eligible for competition must be substantially similar to the Skerry design as published by CLC. Variations due to home-building are anticipated, but they must not materially affect performance.

### 3.2 Registration

Each racing boat must register with its fleet and the Association, declaring rig type and providing a record of construction details (materials, modifications, weight corrections, etc.).

### 3.3 Measurement Authority

Measurements shall be conducted by a fleet measurer appointed by the Fleet Captain. Should disputes arise, final authority rests with the Class Association officers.

### 3.4 Measurement Certificates

Boats that have passed measurement will receive a certificate of compliance valid until altered by repair or modification.

## 4. Technical Rules

### 4.1 Hull and Structure

- Boats must measure 15’0” in length overall and 4’6” in beam, within builder tolerance.
- Hull form must replicate the published Skerry design: double-ended, glued-lapstrake plywood construction.
- Flotation: Standard air tanks or equivalent closed-cell foam must keep the swamped boat and crew afloat.
- Minimum boat weight: 95 lbs dry. Corrector weights may be required.


### 4.2 Rig and Sails

- Supported rigs: Balanced Lug, Sprit, and Sloop rigs as published in the official Skerry plans.
- Fleets may race rigs separately or together under a handicap system.
- Within rig divisions, sails must be substantially similar in cut, material, and area. Plans-specified sails, or sails sourced from an approved sailmaker, are recommended.
- Spars must be of wood construction and built to the plan dimensions.


### 4.3 Foils

- Daggerboard and rudder must conform to the plan’s shape, dimensions, and placement.
- Construction may use appropriate marine wood materials; modifications for performance gain are not allowed.


### 4.4 Equipment

- Running rigging may be upgraded for safety and durability, with fleet approval.
- Hiking straps or other hiking aids are prohibited.
- Crewing arrangements are flexible; fleets may regulate crew weight or acknowledge its natural effect on performance.

## 5. Racing Rules

### 5.1 Rules of Competition

Races will be conducted under the World Sailing *Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS)*, except as specifically modified by this document or local sailing instructions.

### 5.2 Divisions

Local fleets may organize separate divisions for each rig type or race them together under a mutually agreed handicap.

### 5.3 Race Format

Local fleets determine course types, scoring systems, and series formats. Consistency with low-key, accessible competition is prioritized.

### 5.4 Safety

All sailors must wear USCG-approved personal flotation devices when racing. Boats must carry any additional safety gear required by host clubs or event organizers.

### 5.5 Sportsmanship

Competitors are expected to assist other sailors in distress, show respect and courtesy, and prioritize safety before competition.

***

## 6. Amendments and Rule Changes

- Amendments to these rules may be proposed by any member of the Association.
- Proposed changes must be submitted in writing to the Secretary.
- Amendments require approval by a majority of voting members at a scheduled Association meeting or online vote.
- Technical rule changes (e.g., on specs or equipment) must have the recommendation of the Commodore and Fleet Captain before being put to a vote.

***

## 7. Local Fleets and Events

### 7.1 Fleet Recognition

Any group of three or more Skerry Sport boats may apply for recognition as a local fleet.

### 7.2 Fleet Autonomy

Fleets may establish additional local policies (e.g., crew weight rules, handicaps) but may not contradict class rules.

### 7.3 Championships

The Association may sponsor regional or national championship regattas, at which boats must present valid measurement certificates.

***

## 8. Spirit of the Class

The Skerry Sport One-Design class is intended for sailors who value craftsmanship, accessibility, skill development, and community. While modest competition is encouraged, the emphasis remains on inclusivity and fellowship on the water.

Would you like me to also **draft a short “builder’s declaration of compliance” form** (something sailors could fill out and present to a measurer or fleet captain) so that local clubs have a ready-made template for registration?
